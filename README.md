# bunkers-and-badasses
 The Bunkers and Badasses System created for use with Foundry VTT.
 
 Known Issues:
 * Irritatingly, Effects just don't like to work...
 * Posting items to chat just posts [Object object] instead of any useful data.
 * When two or more item sheets are open, changing the rarity of one changes the text of the others. This purely a visual bug, and does not actually update their rarity.
 * The 'misc' bonuses for melee, shooting, and throwing (grenades and otherwise) are not exposed to the sheet and cannot be updated... yet.
 * No mayhem counter available.
 * Miscellaneous HTML/CSS issues.
